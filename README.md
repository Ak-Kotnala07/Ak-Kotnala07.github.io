## Projects

### 1. Predicting Student Depression with Interpretable AI
* **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict student depression from academic and non-academic factors, achieving 87% accuracy. The key focus was on model interpretability using SHAP to understand the "why" behind the predictions.
* **Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas
* **[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Ak-Kotnala07/your-project-repo-name-here)**

### 2. Stock Return Prediction using News Sentiment
* **Description:** Built an end-to-end pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of financial news and predict stock market returns.
* **Technologies:** Python, NLTK, Pandas, Scikit-learn
